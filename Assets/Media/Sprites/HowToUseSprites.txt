The best way to create sprite gameobjects is to simply drag the sprite into your scene.

This will create a new game object with a sprite renderer component set to that sprite.
Sprite renderers using the default sprite material also have a tint property that tints
the sprite.  This means that, using the 32x32 white square in this folder, you can
create platforms of any size and color.
