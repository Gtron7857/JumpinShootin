# JumpinShootin

## What is this?
JumpinShootin is a sandbox for two people to mess around with Git and Unity development.

## Why is the media folder empty?
In the interest of not having our repo size balloon uncontrollably, media files such as sprites and sound files
are handled by sharing asset packages.  In the future, there will be a link here to an assetpackage containing the most
recent contents of the media folder.
